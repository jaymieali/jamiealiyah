                    <h1>Our restaurant is a collective of amazing people striving to build delightful Cuisine in Brampton</h1><br>
                    <p>Pixie`s Resto Bar was founded on the belief that food has the power to shape our daily lives. That real, wholesome ingredients, prepared simply and with integrity, can provide us with the energy to take on the day with ambition and optimism. When we stop counting, obsessing, stressing, and ‘dieting’ we begin to feel better, love better, look better, and live happier. This positive lifestyle has the potential to make a real and lasting impact on ourselves and the world around us. So we created a place where anyone can be confident that the food they are eating supports the life they want to lead. We work closely with our farmers and suppliers to ensure all our fresh, local, and organic ingredients are of the highest quality.</p>
